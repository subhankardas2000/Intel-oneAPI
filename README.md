The Poisson Equation, and its special case, the
Laplace Equation, are important partial differential equations
within electrostatics, as they describe the electric potential field
caused by a particular charge distribution. Solving the Poisson
equation for a given set of boundary conditions is a fundamental
problem within the field. This report describes an algorithm for a
Monte Carlo Method solution to the Poisson and Laplace
equations. Monte Carlo Method is a parallelizable non-
deterministic numerical approach towards solving this problem.
A Python implementation is also provided for three versions of the
Monte Carlo Method: Fixed Step, Semi-Floating and Full
Floating. Several examples including the one-dimensional and
two-dimensional parallel plate capacitors are performed to
illustrate the function of the implementation.
